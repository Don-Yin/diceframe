"""Read-only combat turn view derived from the bound ruleset's authority.

``combat_state`` / ``combat_active`` / ``initiative_order`` /
``initiative_current`` are NOT stored anywhere. They are derived on every read
from the bound ruleset's own encounter authority through a projector the
ruleset registers with :func:`register_combat_projector` (D&D 2024 projects
``ruleset_state["combat"]``). A game whose runtime has no registered projector
(unbound, generic rulesets, unknown runtime ids) reads the neutral view:
``"none"`` / ``False`` / ``[]`` / ``0``.

``src/engine`` must not import ``src/rulesets``; the registry is the seam.
Projectors are resolved through :func:`ruleset_runtime.bound_runtime_id`, a
read that never materializes or repairs a module slot.

This module owns no persisted state. The former ``modules["legacy_combat"]``
slot (and its generic ``combat_enemies`` list) was retired; instance
migration v42 -> v43 drops it from old saves. Generic hp_based /
lethal_narrative combat targets players by uid and NPCs by ``npc:<id>``. A
future generic encounter authority is a separate design, not this module.

The core flow reads the view only through ``module_hooks.combat_view``; without
this module every game reads the neutral view.
